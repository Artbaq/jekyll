We welcome [feedback](../feedback.html) on any aspect of the Programming Historian. Let us know what we can do to make the project better!

We are especially grateful for tips about lessons that seem to be broken. As URLs change and as new versions of software and platforms are released, lessons develop glitches over time. Please help us keep the _Programming Historian_ up to date by letting us know about these when you come across them in the course of your reading. 

## Write a new lesson

We welcome submissions of [new lessons][submissions] from authors!

Writing a tutorial is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills and actively engage in the digital humanities community.

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft and hone your topic and approach, as well as to make your tutorial as clear and as useful as possible. Our peer review process helps improve your lessons even further, as well as improve your technical writing skills. Please read more about our [submission process][submissions].

If you'd like to propose a lesson (for you or for someone else to write), email <a href="mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca">Ian Milligan</a>.
