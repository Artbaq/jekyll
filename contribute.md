As URLs change and as new versions of software and platforms are released, lessons develop glitches over time. Please help us keep _Programming Historian_ up to date by letting us know about these. You can report problems or make suggestions by following our instructions on [how to create an issue in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/wiki/Reporting-Issues).

Academic peer review is essential for producing trusted high-quality resources, and even as a free, open-source, community-driven resource _Programming Historian_, holds peer review in the highest regard. But we prefer an open and collaborative process--where reviewers get full and public credit for their work--to traditional closed and opaque procedures. For more on our review philosophy and procedures, please see the [Guidelines for Reviewers][reviewers].

We hope you'll consider joining our team of reviewers in a way that fits your own schedule. Please email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> with a bit of information about yourself, especially the specific skills, tools, topics, and technologies that you'd like to be involved with so that we can send you the most appropriate lessons to review.

From our own experience, we know that the difficult job of writing technically challenging but accessible tutorials is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills and actively engage in the digital humanities community.

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft and hone your topic and approach, as well as to make your tutorial as clear and as useful as possible. Our peer review process helps improve your lessons even further, as well as improve your technical writing skills.

If you'd like to suggest idea to make _Programming Historian_ a more useful resource for you, or propose a lesson (for you or for someone else to write), email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> with your ideas! 

Please read more about our [submission proceess][submissions].
