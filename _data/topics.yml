  description: "Computational tools allow you to make sense of a lot of documents at once. The Naive Bayesian is a machine learner. Given some examples of the kind of thing you are interested in, it can quickly find many more. A topic modeling tool takes a single text (or corpus) and looks for patterns in the use of words; it is an attempt to inject semantic meaning into vocabulary. It can help you to very quickly find ‘topics’ in a large corpus of texts."

  description: "If you’re new to programming, these lessons will help you get your computer set up correctly. For example, if you're new to Python, you’ll first need to set up a programming environment. For the most flexibility, we recommend that you follow [these instructions on setting up python on the command line](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html). Many of the tutorials require that you install one or more Python modules to save you time coding. If this is a new concept for you, read about how to install Python modules in the lesson below."
