The Programming Historian is an online, open access, peer reviewed suite of tutorials that help humanists (though slanted towards historians) learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. Despite the name, we do not focus exclusively on programming, but rather aim to provide guidance on a variety of digital methods and approaches.

Our mission is to fill a unique niche for those interested in the Digital Humanities. Although there are many guides to “getting started in the Digital Humanities,” and plenty of “teach yourself programming” websites, The Programming Historian is the only resource dedicated to bridging the substantial gap between broad “getting started” portal sites and generic programming tutorials that usually seem unhelpful to humanists who don’t have a programming background.

We’ve assembled and carefully edited a variety of lessons that describe and illustrate fundamental programming principles and techniques–such as scraping data from web pages and altering its format to work with various visualization tools–based on real-world examples of historical research. But we’re not all about programming. We offer much more as well, including nearly a dozen tutorials on various popular DH tools, such as MALLET, Omeka, and QGIS.

If you can’t find what you’re looking for, then we’ve failed you. But don’t suffer in silence! Let us know what you can’t find. Better yet, [contribute a lesson](contribute).

Peer Review
---

All tutorials that appear on the Programming Historian have been rigorously peer reviewed and copy edited. Each lesson is guided through the review process by one of our editors who are assigned to the piece. Review involves a thorough exchange with the editor to ensure the lesson works and that all concepts are explained fully for a non-specialist reader, before the tutorial is sent to external reviewers to test it and provide further comments. We aim to return reviewed material to authors quickly, but our first priority is always to ensure a quality product.

We strive to ensure all tutorials are functional on their date of publication. From time to time technology changes and tutorials cease to function as intended. If this happens, please [report it](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/wiki/Reporting-Issues) and we will assign an editor to fix the problem.
