## The Role of the Editor

Thank you for editing a lesson for the *Programming Historian*. We are extremely grateful for your efforts. This guide is meant to ensure that all authors, editors, and reviewers receive a consistent and fair experience with the *Programming Historian*. If you have any questions about anything in these guidelines, please email one of the other editors or post a question on our [Github issues](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues). Do the same if you think these guidelines need improvement or updating.

We always encourage prospective authors to pitch their ideas before they start writing. We do not act as gatekeepers in the same way as a traditional journal. If a piece is not suitable for the *Programming Historian* our job is to tell an author before they have written a full tutorial. We hope this saves everyone time and energy. Once we have spoken to an author and encouraged their idea, our aim is always to support authors until the piece is publishable. Our goal is to help them reach that stage as efficiently as possible with clear guidance. You may find it helpful to familiarise yourself with our [instructions for authors](http://programminghistorian.org/new-lesson-workflow)

## Safe Spaces

The *Programming Historian* is committed to providing a safe space for the exchange of ideas, where everyone can share without fear of harassment or abuse. The editor plays a fundamental role in ensuring that space endures. Your job includes enforcing our anti-harassment policy at all times. If you need help please ask one of the other editors. You can read more about our [commitment to safe spaces](http://programminghistorian.org/posts/PH-commitment-to-diversity) on the project blog:

### Anti-Harassment Policy

This is a statement of the *Programming Historian's* principles and sets expectations for the tone and style of all correspondence between reviewers, authors, editors, and contributors to our public forums.

The *Programming Historian* is dedicated to providing an open scholarly environment that offers community participants the freedom to thoroughly scrutize ideas, to ask questions, make suggestions, or to requests for clarification, but also provides a harassment-free space for all contributors to the project, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion, or technical experience. We do not tolerate harassment or ad hominem attacks of community participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the community at the discretion of the editorial board. If anyone witnesses or feels they have been the victim of the above described activity, please contact our ombudsperson (Ian Milligan - http://programminghistorian.org/project-team). Thank you for helping us to create a safe space.

## Open Peer Review

The *Programming Historian* uses a model of open peer review, while we believe this helps maintain civility and the productive sharing of ideas, authors have the right (and we have a requirement to respect that right) to request a closed peer review. There are many reasons why someone might be hesitant to engage in an open review and we encourage authors to always pursue the option with which they are most comfortable.

Before soliciting external reviews, the editor should read and try the tutorial and use their experience with the *Programming Historian* to help the author make initial improvements (if required). Often editors need help clarifying the intended audience of a lesson, or identifying jargon that needs further explanation. This initial review helps let the external reviewers focus on improving the piece. This is normally done openly on our submission system (see below), but it can be a closed review at the request of either party.

Once an author has revised the tutorial to the satisfaction of the editor, it is the editor's job to invite two formal external peer reviews. It is entirely up to the editor who these reviewers are, however in the interest of our [commitment to diversity](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues), we encourage editors to ask themselves if they have made a sufficient effort to draw from reviewers who are distinct from themselves either by gender, nationality, race, age, or academic background. Please try not to find two people who are very like you.

When inviting reviewers, provide them with our [reviewer guidelines](http://programminghistorian.org/reviewer-guidelines) and give them a deadline for completing their review (usually one month) so that we can ensure the timely publication of the tutorial.

When a lesson has been submitted, the editor will open a new 'issue' on our [Github submissions repository](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/issues) where the open review will take place. This messsage board allows everyone to keep track of the conversation. You will need to sign up for a free Github account if you do not already have one, as will both the author and reviewers.

### The Initial Comment

Your first comment on the message board for a given tutorial review should use our template which outlines the role of the editor and what will take place during the review, as well as everyone's options in the unlikely event that something goes wrong. Please adapt the following template as needed:

    The Programming Historian has received the following tutorial on 'Editing Audio with Audacity' by @bmw9t. This lesson is now under review and can be read at:
    
    http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/editing-audio-with-audacity
    
    I will act as editor for the review process. My role is to solicit two reviews from the community and to manage the discussions, which should be held here on this forum. I have already read through the lesson and provided feedback, to which the author has responded.
    
    Members of the wider community are also invited to offer constructive feedback which should post to this message thread, but they are asked to first read our Reviewer Guidelines (http://programminghistorian.org/reviewer-guidelines) and to adhere to our anti-harassment policy (below). We ask that all reviews stop after the second formal review has been submitted so that the author can focus on any revisions. I will make an announcement on this thread when that has occurred.
    
    I will endeavor to keep the conversation open here on Github. If anyone feels the need to discuss anything privately, you are welcome to email me. You can always turn to @ianmilligan1 if you feel there's a need for an ombudsperson to step in.

## Maintaining Order

Everyone will be looking to you as the editor for guidance on the system. For most authors and editors this will be their first experience with our peer review process. The immediate feedback offered by the message board means that authors may see the reviewer comments before you do. That means you will have to clearly signpost how everything will work and when everyone should participate or wait for further instruction.

If possible it is always best to acknowledge review milestones as soon as possible. For example, after the first review has come in, post a response to thank the reviewer and let the author know that another review is on its way. Suggest that they wait for the second review before responding. This lets everyone know what to expect.

If you are really busy, if possible make a note on the forum to say you have seen the new activity, but will need some time to respond properly. Managing expectations can be key to keeping everyone happy.

## Summarising the Review

Once the two formal reviews are in (as well as any informal contributions from the community), you will have to summarise the suggestions and give the author a clear path for any revisions that you would like them to respond to. If any suggestions are counter to our aims at the *Programming Historian*, politely tell the author to forego those suggestions. Keep in mind what it is like to be an author and receive a review. You want clear guidance, but also the right to reject ideas that don't improve the piece. You also want assurance that you are not trying to hit a moving target. A good summary of reviews means an author can respond and expect publication if all significant obstacles are met.


## Technical Processes of Review

Our peer review is conducted on our [Submissions repository](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions) on Github. Full instructions for how to upload files, including file formats and formatting guidelines can be found on our [Author Submission Instructions](http://programminghistorian.org/new-lesson-workflow) which will always contain the most up to date instructions. Please familiarise yourself with these steps or refer to them as needed. If you need help you are always welcome to [email another editor directly](http://programminghistorian.org/project-team).

There are a few areas where you should intervene in the process from a technical standpoint. They include:

### Naming the Lesson File
The **Editor** should suggest a name for the new lesson file that conforms to these guidelines:

- Make the filename short, but descriptive; this filename will eventually become the slug for the lesson's URL when published.
- A good URL would fit nicely on a powerpoint slide, is easy to remember, and tells you something about the lesson. Our URLS take the following format: http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/FILENAME-HERE
- Do not put spaces in the filename; use hyphens instead.
- The filename extension should be `.md` so that GitHub will generate a preview of the lesson.

### Initial Check of Markdown
Authors are responsible for checking that their lesson has rendered properly in markdown. If they have followed the syntax rules, they should do. Detailed instructions of Markdown syntax are available on our [Author Guidelines](http://programminghistorian.org/new-lesson-workflow)

You can quickly check that everything looks ok on a lesson submission by looking at the rendered version of the page. It will be found at:

http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/FILENAME-HERE (note - no .md at the end)

### Verify Images

All images should use consistent, serially numbered filenames that clearly relate to the lesson in which they will appear--ideally using the same hyphenated filename slug as the lesson itself (or an abbreviated version if the lesson title is rather long), followed by numbers to indicate which figure it is (For example, `counting-frequencies-1.png`, `counting-frequencies-2.png`, and so on.) Make sure the images are in web-friendly formats such as PNG or JPEG and sized appropriately (both in terms of pixels and bytes).

Full instructions on adding images is available in [Author Submission Instructions](http://programminghistorian.org/new-lesson-workflow).

It is possible that figure numbering will change during the peer review process. We ask that before a lesson is published that all filenames are updated to the proper figure numbers. This makes it much easier for us to update lessons if needed in the future. Thank you for helping us keep the *Programming Historian* sustainable.

A lesson's images should be stored in the following location:

 - /images/FILENAME-HERE/FILENAME-HERE-1.png
 - /images/FILENAME-HERE/FILENAME-HERE-2.png
 - /images/FILENAME-HERE/FILENAME-HERE-3.png
 - etc

### Verify Data files

Similarly to Images, all data files should be stored on the site (not linked externally - for sustainability purposes). All data should be stored in the 'assets' directory, using the same rules as above, but authors should feel free to use a description for their data file that reflects what it is:

 - /assets/FILENAME-HERE/Louvre-Paintings-1.csv

---

## Acceptance and Publication

Once you and the author are happy with a tutorial, the next step is to move the lesson from the Submissions site to our main repository that hosts the live website.

### Moving the Files

*CAN SOMEONE ELSE WRITE THIS SECTION? I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW -AC*

## Create an Author Bio

If the lesson has been written by a new author, editors should add information about the author to the site's [authors directory](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/blob/gh-pages/_data/authors.yml). Follow the syntax for the examples already included there:

```yaml
- name: Jim Clifford
  bio: |
       Jim Clifford is an assistant professor in the Department of History 
       at the University of Saskatchewan.
```

**Whitespace is important**, so be sure that the indentation matches the other examples.

## Add reviewers to the YAML file

It is important that we acknowledge the work of our peer reviewers. To the YAML file at the top of the tutorial, add the names of the reviewers who helped work on the piece (including your own), as well as the names of any members of the community who contributed substantial open reviews. YAML formatting instructions can be found on [Author Guidelines](http://programminghistorian.org/new-lesson-workflow).

## Find an Image to represent the lesson

We represent our lessons using an old image that we feel captures some element of the task described in the tutorial. You can see the full range of these on the [main Lessons directory](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/). These images are selected by editors.

Here are a few places to look for lesson images:
* [British Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary)
* [Internet Archive Book Images](https://www.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages)
* [Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland](https://www.flickr.com/photos/e-codices)
* [Library of Congress Maps](http://www.loc.gov/maps/collections)

Ensure that the image matches the style of the other images (it should be a book image, not a photograph), is at least 200 pixels in both dimensions, and is not copyright restricted. Make sure the image is not offensive, and keeping with our [Commitment to Diversity](http://programminghistorian.org/posts/PH-commitment-to-diversity) try to find something that does not perpetuate stereotypes or send a subtle message about maleness and whiteness.

Save the original image. The filename should be the same as the corresponding lesson’s URL slug with `-original` at the end, and the filetype should be `.png`. For example, the lesson “Cleaning Data with OpenRefine” has the URL slug `cleaning-data-with-openrefine`, so its original lesson image filename should be `cleaning-data-with-openrefine-original.png`.

Then, create a new copy of the image. Crop it to a square without removing any important features. Change the dimensions to 200x200 pixels. Convert the image to grayscale. Perform any adjustments necessary to make it conform to the other lesson images, such as lightening or darkening it, or altering the contrast. Save this new image as the lesson’s URL slug. In our previous example, the filename would be `cleaning-data-with-openrefine.png`.

Upload the original image to the [gallery/originals](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/tree/gh-pages/gallery/originals) folder, and upload the edited image to the [gallery](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/tree/gh-pages/gallery) folder.

Add the image to the lessons page by editing the HTML in [lessons/index.md](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/blob/gh-pages/lessons/index.md) so that the image source matches the new image’s file location. In our previous example, the HTML line would be: `<img src="../gallery/cleaning-data-with-openrefine.png">`. The new image should appear on the [Lessons page]( http://programminghistorian.org/lessons)!


## Thank Everyone and Encourage Promotion

It's important to send an email or message to everyone involved thanking them for their efforts. In particular, thank the author for contributing and encourage them to think of us again in future. It's also worth giving the author some ideas on promoting their lesson. The most-used lessons always have authors' energies behind them. For example authors should be encouraged to:

- Tweet at least 3 times about their lesson (with a link).
- Retweet our tweets about their lesson ('liking' does not help spread the word)
- Promote their lesson in presentations or publications about their research
- Link to it in blog posts when relevant
- Add it to lists of resources in relevant repositories (eg, Wikipedia, community groups, etc).

People don't find lessons on their own. The hard work is done, so let's make sure it was worth it!
